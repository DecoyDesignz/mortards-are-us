Have an imput for mortar location and altitude
Have an imput for target location and altitude
Have a time of flight
Display the range from the mortar
Display the deflection and elevation in both Mils 6400 and Degrees 360
Automatically select the best charge ring that will reach the target
Give multiple charge solutions depending on range of the target
Have an imput for adjust fire that takes you to the adjustment options
Allows for adjustment of the fall of shot using Add, drop, left and right and adjust off of a set direction being expressed in either mils or degrees
Have an imput for fire for effect
Have sheaf distributions dependant on how many mortars are available and allow the calculator to individually imput each mortar location
Sheaf distributions: open, closed, liniar, rectangular
open sheaf will keep each round landing atleast 50m around the target location minimum mortars needed
closed sheaf will keep each round landing on the target location
Liniar sheaf will create an aimpoint for each mortar in a line, this will also have the abillity to change the disance between each round and the overall length and the attitude of the liniar spread
Allow for multiple missions and automatically save in a list once created
Allow for the ability to create target lists, a named folder that allows for multiple targets to be saved within
Allow for these targets and lists to be deleted
